# Canal da Pe√ßa - Merlin's Potions

### Simple responsive website built for testing and improving my knowledge.

This project was made using a Microsoft's IDE, called Visual Studio Code.

Basically, it's an e-commerce that allows the costumer to get information and buy different types of medieval potions.
Each one of the items has its specific description, following the rule:

- Potion Name
- Use/Effect
- Ingredient list
- Price
