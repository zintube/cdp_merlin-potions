# Canal da Pe√ßa - Merlin's Potions

### Simple responsive website built for testing and improving my knowledge.

This project was made using a Microsoft's IDE - Visual Studio Code.

Basically, it's an e-commerce that allows the costumer to get information and buy different types of medieval potions.
Each one of the items has its specific description, following the rule:

- Potion Name
- Use/Effect
- Ingredient list
- Price

#### How was it made?

Definitely, the easiest way possible. First, the navbar was made using nothing but HTML5/CSS3, then, a framework called Bootstrap to make the image grid responsive.

The item's descriptions were set up by an external JavaScript archive, linked on top of the project. Here, I managed informations in JSON format. 

Finally, I finished the project adding some hover effect's on buttons and building the two-columns footer.
